"""The Magic 8 Ball is a popular office toy and children's toy invented in the 1940s for fortune-telling and advice seeking. ðŸŽ±

It's an oversized 8-ball with some of the following answers:

    1 Yes - definitely.
    2 It is decidedly so.
    3 Without a doubt.
    4 Reply hazy, try again.
    5 Ask again later.
    6 Better not tell you now.
    7 My sources say no.
    8 Outlook not so good.
    9 Very doubtful.

Create a magic8.py program that can respond to any Yes or No questions with a different answer each time it executes.

The output should have the following format:

Question:      [Question]
Magic 8 Ball:  [Answer]

For example:

Question:      Is CodÃ©dex better than Udemy yet?
Magic 8 Ball:  Better not tell you now.
